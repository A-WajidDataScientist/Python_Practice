# Exercise: Python Variables

# Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.

# Create two variables. One to store your birth year and another one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables

# Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and then print your full name using these variables

# Answer which of these are invalid variable names: _nation 1record record1 record_one record-one record^one continue

# Q1 break = 5 #break key it doesn't used for variable name

# Q2
brith_year = 2000
current_year = 2023

my_age = current_year - brith_year

print(my_age)

# Q3
first_name = "Abdul"
second_name = "Wajid"
last_name = "Ansari"
print(first_name, second_name, last_name)

# Q4
# _nation: valid
#  1record: invalid
#  record1: valid
#  record_one: valid
#  record-one: invalid
#  record^one: invalid
#  continue: invalid
