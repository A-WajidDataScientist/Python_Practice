# Python Collections (Arrays)
# There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

# List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
# Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
# Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

L = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(L)
L[0] = 10
print(L)

# Insert Items
# To insert a new list item, without replacing any of the existing values, we can use the insert() method.

# The insert() method inserts an item at the specified index:

# Example
# Insert "watermelon" as the third item:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
thislist.insert(3, 100)
print(thislist)

thislist.extend(L)
print(thislist)


# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on lists.

# Method	Description
# append()	Adds an element at the end of the list
# clear()	Removes all the elements from the list
# copy()	Returns a copy of the list
# count()	Returns the number of elements with the specified value
# extend()	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
# index()	Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
# insert()	Adds an element at the specified position
# pop()	Removes the element at the specified position
# remove()	Removes the item with the specified value
# reverse()	Reverses the order of the list
# sort()	Sorts the list
